Model without data cleaning.  Performs better than model without data cleaning.  

1. Run SelfDrivingSimulationModelTrainingwithnoImageManipulation
   A.  You will need to change the directory where you have stored images and where you want to save the model
2. Run SelfDrivingPredictwithnoImageManipulation
   A.  You will need to change the directory where you have stored images and where you have saved the model, as well as where to save videos
3. If you don't have access to a computer with a GPU, you can use my trained model and skip step 1.
