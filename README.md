# SelfDrivingSimulation
This repository takes a video from a webcam attached to a vehicle as the feature data and pairs it with the angle of the steering wheel as the target.  We then apply datatransformers to manipulate the data.  The artificial intelligence model uses the DAVE2 neural network to predict the wheel's steering angle.
